Project Flow Summary

1. Hero Section

The hero section serves as the landing page introduction, setting the tone for the website. It includes:

- A bold headline (e.g., "Explore the World of Mythology").
- A subheadline or tagline (e.g., "Dive into the stories, gods, and creatures from cultures around the world").
- Two call-to-action buttons:
  "Explore Myths" : Guides users to the categories page for mythology exploration.
  "Read Blog" : Directs users to the blog page for storytelling and myth-related articles.

2. Categories Page
   After clicking "Explore Myths," users are taken to the Categories Page , which organizes content into high-level categories. Categories are presented as visually appealing cards, each representing a broad classification:

- "Browse by Culture" : Explore myths by cultural origin (e.g., Greek, Norse, Egyptian).
- "Browse by Theme" : Discover myths based on themes (e.g., War, Love, Creation).
- "Browse by Element" : Filter myths by elements (e.g., Fire, Water, Earth).

Each card includes:

- Background art relevant to the category.
  Category name (e.g., "Greek").
- A short description (e.g., "Discover gods, heroes, and creatures from ancient Greece").
- Clicking on a category card navigates the user to the Subcategories Page .

3. Subcategories Page
   The Subcategories Page allows users to refine their selection within the chosen category. For example:

If "Browse by Culture" → Greek → Subcategories: "Gods," "Heroes," "Artifacts," "Creatures."

If "Browse by Theme" → War → Subcategories: "Warriors," "Weapons," "Battles."

Subcategories are displayed in a clean, grid-based layout with clear labels. Clicking on a subcategory displays the relevant Myth Cards Page .

4. Myth Cards Page
   The Myth Cards Page presents a responsive grid of myth cards, each providing an overview of a specific myth. Each card includes:

Myth name (e.g., "Zeus").
Image (e.g., a statue of Zeus).

Tags (e.g., "Greek," "Titan," "Warrior").

Brief description (e.g., "King of the Olympian gods").
Quote (e.g., "I am the lightning in the sky").
